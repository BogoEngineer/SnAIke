# SnAIke
Reinforcement learning algorithm applied to a simple snake game by using neat module. Learning is accomplished by a small neural network( 2 input nodes and 4 output nodes). 
The goal of this project is to visualize evolutionary algorithm by running one snake at a time. Snakes learn throughout generations, with each generation getting better overall scores. The first genome(snake) that has satisfying results appears in generation 16.
